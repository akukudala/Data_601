## Brief history of Data Science

The term “Data Science” has evolved over the years with the drastic increase in data. It initially began in statistics. As the world is producing Big Data, new technologies were found to make right use of the data and use commercially to increase the growth of organizations. Data Science has the inclusion of concepts such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and the internet of things to extract the required insights of the vast stores of big data.
The past records can help to predict a proposal to change data analysis workflows. Companies are collecting the information about us, our interests and how to influence us to buy their products. This marketing strategy is the approach to save our search history and keep reminding with their offers until we purchase the product and then to show the related items once we purchase. It is a chain of algorithms which is implemented to advertise their products.
In 1980s, the required technologies were not emerged to handle a lot of information and to extract the important data from it. Eventually, finding useful patterns in data has been increasing by including data mining, knowledge extraction, information discovery, information harvesting, data archeology, and data pattern processing.
KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) refers to the overall process of discovering useful information from data.
Most of the data analysts and mathematicians had already predicted that Data Science is going to be hugely important skill with the increase in the social media usage. Few Professors mention statistics to be renamed as data science and statisticians to be renamed as data scientists.
